# REAPER

This project is for larger shared dev clusters where users may not use autoscalers or clean up after themselves.

## Instalation
This won't actually work right now without releasing the Docker image
```
git clone https://github.com/jcatana/reaper.git
cd reaper/helm/reaper
k create namespace reaper
helm -n reaper install . 
```
